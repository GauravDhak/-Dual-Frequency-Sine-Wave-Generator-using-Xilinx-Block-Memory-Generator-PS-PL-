# -Dual-Frequency-Sine-Wave-Generator-using-Xilinx-Block-Memory-Generator-PS-PL-
this project implements a Dual-Frequency Sine Wave Generator using Xilinx Vivado, where sine wave samples are stored in Block RAM via the Block Memory Generator IP. The design is implemented using a combination of Processing System (PS) and Programmable Logic (PL) on an FPGA SoC (like Zynq).
